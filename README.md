# KitPVP
I made this plugin in the past for a server that decided to shut down, so it was discontinued.
Now I have published it on discord so that people who want to can use it to make their own plugins.

## Features
### Kit Creator
- Every player can create kits when in the editor area (configurable in config.yml)
- Every player can only edit their own kits
- Players can fight with their custom kits

### Queue System
- The plugin has a simple queue system where players can click an NPC to add themself to a queue
- Queued players will automaticly be paired to fight against each other with a random kid

### Config
- You can probably change every message send to the player in language.yml


## What needs to be change to make this plugin useful
- Disable item dropping
- Create some kind of fighting world where you teleport the players to
